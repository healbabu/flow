# DialogFlow Flow Analysis Prompt

## Context
You are an expert DialogFlow architect tasked with analyzing a conversational flow for potential issues, dead ends, and user experience problems. Your goal is to identify architectural weaknesses and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Flow Structure Analysis
- **Entry Points**: Identify all possible ways users can enter the flow
- **Exit Points**: Map all termination points and session endings
- **Navigation Paths**: Trace all possible user journeys through the flow
- **Decision Points**: Identify where users make choices and what happens for each option

### 2. Dead End Detection
- **Terminal Pages**: Find pages that end sessions without providing continuation options
- **Error States**: Identify scenarios where users might get stuck due to errors
- **Missing Handlers**: Look for user inputs that aren't handled
- **Incomplete Flows**: Find paths that don't lead to logical conclusions

### 3. User Experience Assessment
- **Flexibility**: Can users navigate freely or are they forced into linear paths?
- **Error Recovery**: How well does the flow handle user mistakes or unclear inputs?
- **Information Flow**: Do users have enough information to make decisions?
- **Confirmation Patterns**: Are confirmations clear and allow for corrections?

### 4. Intent Coverage Analysis
- **Missing Intents**: What user intents might not be covered?
- **Intent Conflicts**: Are there overlapping or conflicting intents?
- **Fallback Handling**: How are unrecognized inputs handled?
- **Context Management**: How well does the flow maintain context?

### 5. Technical Architecture Review
- **Form Validation**: Are required fields properly validated?
- **Parameter Management**: How are user inputs stored and used?
- **Event Handling**: Are system events properly managed?
- **Session Management**: How is user state maintained?

## Specific Questions to Answer

### Flow Continuity
1. Can users easily navigate back to previous steps?
2. Are there "start over" or "cancel" options available?
3. What happens if users want to modify earlier decisions?
4. Are there graceful exits at every major decision point?

### Error Handling
1. What happens when users provide invalid inputs?
2. Are error messages helpful and actionable?
3. Do users get stuck in error loops?
4. Are there fallback options when the flow fails?

### User Intent Coverage
1. What common user requests might not be handled?
2. Are there edge cases that could confuse users?
3. How well does the flow handle ambiguous inputs?
4. Are there missing confirmation or clarification steps?

### Information Architecture
1. Do users have enough context to make decisions?
2. Is information presented in logical order?
3. Are there opportunities for users to ask questions?
4. Is pricing and availability information clear?

## Output Format

### Critical Issues (High Priority)
- List dead ends and terminal points without exit options
- Identify missing error handlers
- Point out incomplete user journeys
- Flag missing navigation options

### User Experience Issues (Medium Priority)
- Identify inflexible or linear flows
- Point out unclear error messages
- Flag missing information or context
- Identify confusing confirmation patterns

### Architectural Improvements (Low Priority)
- Suggest missing intents
- Recommend better parameter management
- Propose enhanced error handling
- Suggest flow optimizations

### Testing Scenarios
- Provide specific test cases for dead ends
- Suggest edge case testing scenarios
- Recommend error condition testing
- Propose user journey testing

## Evaluation Criteria

### Flow Completeness
- ✅ All user paths lead to logical conclusions
- ✅ Users can navigate freely within the flow
- ✅ Error states have recovery mechanisms
- ✅ Terminal points provide continuation options

### User Experience
- ✅ Users have enough information to make decisions
- ✅ Error messages are helpful and actionable
- ✅ Confirmation steps are clear and allow corrections
- ✅ Flow accommodates different user preferences

### Technical Robustness
- ✅ All required fields are properly validated
- ✅ System events are handled appropriately
- ✅ Context is maintained throughout the flow
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms exist for failures

Please analyze the provided DialogFlow data and provide a comprehensive report following this framework.
